Subject: Request for Release from Current Assignment

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Over the past four years, I’ve been part of the clean room environment, which, while technically enriching, has limited my exposure to broader learning and social interactions. The shift schedules—especially the night shifts—have also impacted my health, leading to sleep disturbances, weight-related issues, and episodes of low blood sugar. I’ve experienced physical discomfort during work, which has prompted me to reassess my overall well-being.

Despite these challenges, I’ve remained proactive in my professional development. I joined the team with a full-stack certification and am currently pursuing a part-time degree in data engineering. However, I’ve found limited opportunities to apply these skills in my current role, and I’m unsure how they align with my responsibilities. I’m eager to contribute more meaningfully and grow in areas that align with my interests and capabilities.

On a personal note, I’ve recently taken on new responsibilities, including a long-distance marriage, which has added to the challenges of managing my current role. While I prefer to keep personal matters private, they have influenced my need for greater flexibility.

Additionally, I’ve been working toward pursuing a master’s degree abroad. Although I’ve faced multiple scholarship rejections, I still have two promising opportunities ahead. I remain hopeful and am making changes to support this goal.

Considering all these factors, I feel I may no longer be the right fit for this project. I kindly request your support in considering my release from the current assignment so I can explore opportunities that better align with my health, personal life, and career aspirations.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Warm regards,
Jude Antony

Subject: Request for Project Release Consideration
Dear [Manager's Name],
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to take a moment to share some personal reflections and request your kind consideration regarding my current role.
Over the past four years, I’ve been part of the clean room environment, which, while technically enriching, has limited my exposure to broader learning and social interactions. The shift schedules—especially the night shifts—have taken a toll on my health, leading to sleep disturbances and weight gain. I’ve even experienced episodes of low blood sugar and physical discomfort during work.
Despite these challenges, I’ve tried to stay proactive. I completed a full-stack certification and am currently pursuing data engineering courses. However, I’m unsure how these skills align with my current responsibilities, and I feel they’re not being utilized effectively.
On a personal note, I’ve been working toward pursuing a master’s degree abroad. Although I’ve faced multiple scholarship rejections, I still have two more opportunities ahead. I’m hopeful, but I also recognize the need to make changes to support this goal.
Additionally, I recently got married, and my wife is based in Chennai. Managing a long-distance relationship alongside the demands of this role has been difficult, and I prefer to keep these personal matters private.
Considering all these factors, I feel I may no longer be the right fit for this project. I kindly request your support in considering my release from the current assignment so I can explore opportunities that better align with my health, personal life, and career aspirations.
Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
Warm regards,
Jude Antony
